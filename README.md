# Edit source code before using. üìù
In the batch script there will be an area in the path called "YOUR USERNAME HERE".
Replace that with your windows username. If you don't know your windows username navigate to "C:\Users\". <br>
Put in anything that looks like your account name.<br> The path should look like this in the file: <br>
"C:\Users\John Doe\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default".

If you want the command prompt window to stop after delting the directory you can put "PAUSE" at the end of the batch file. This<br>
will make it so the command prompt window won't auto-close.
